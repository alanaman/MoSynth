/// Draws the motion field as a 3D point cloud so a misbehaving policy can be watched rather than
/// inferred.
///
/// Every database state is a point, projected to 3D by <c>motion_field_embedding.py</c>. Under that
/// module's default the projection covers the *joint positions* only, so the cloud is a pose
/// manifold: one pose held at two different speeds lands in one place rather than two, and how far
/// apart two points sit means how differently the body is posed and nothing else.
///
/// Velocity is therefore not a displacement here, it is an edge. A state's one-frame lookahead is
/// exactly the next frame of its clip, so the frame-adjacency edges <see cref="BuildEdgeMesh"/>
/// draws are the field's velocity: each line leaves a pose and points at where that pose is going.
/// Read together, the cloud is the set of poses and the edges are the flow over them.
///
/// On top of that static picture, this overlays what the policy is doing right now: where the live
/// pose sits, which neighbours it is choosing between, and which one the tug is pulling it toward.
/// A policy that stalls shows up immediately -- the trail stops sweeping the cloud and collapses to
/// a knot.
///
/// Overlay legend: yellow is the live pose, with a yellow edge ahead to where its neighbourhood
/// flows over the next <c>velocityLookahead</c> frames (the live pose is not a database state, so
/// it has no adjacency edge of its own) and a yellow trail behind it. Cyan is its nearest state,
/// magenta the tug target, green the rest of the neighbourhood with size and brightness following
/// the similarity weight.
///
/// Three things to keep in mind when reading the picture. The tug is the neighbour the *chosen
/// action* emphasises, and actions are chosen on value, so it is routinely not the nearest state.
/// The live pose's edge is built from the plain similarity weights, so it shows where the
/// neighbourhood flows rather than which action was picked -- the magenta marker carries that. And
/// UMAP preserves neighbourhood structure, not distance: two states adjacent in the real metric can
/// land far apart on screen, so judge closeness by the markers, not by the gap.
///
/// Add it to the same GameObject as the <see cref="MotionSynthesisComponent"/> whose stage list
